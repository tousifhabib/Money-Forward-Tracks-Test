# Explanation of SQL Queries for Convenience Store Database
This database contains four tables: shops, employees, items, and sales. To perform specific operations on this database, we are given eight steps, each requiring a different SQL query.

# Step 1: Show the list of shops that have a restroom
This step asks for the SQL query to retrieve a list of shops that have a restroom. We use the SELECT statement to retrieve columns id, name, prefecture, and city from the shops table. We add the WHERE clause to filter out shops that do not have a restroom (restroom = 1). We also use the DISTINCT keyword to ensure that the output results are distinct.

# Step 2: Add a new item
This step asks for the SQL query to add a new item to the items table. We use the INSERT statement to insert a new record into the items table with the given name, category, price, and tax rate. We use the VALUES keyword to specify the values for the columns in the record.

# Step 3: Change the tax rate to 0.10 for items in the category that are not food
This step asks for the SQL query to update the tax rate of items in the items table that are not food. We use the UPDATE statement to modify the tax_rate column in the items table. We use the WHERE clause to filter out items that belong to the food category (category != 0).

# Step 4: Delete items in the food category for which the price without tax is 1000 yen or over
This step asks for the SQL query to delete items in the items table that belong to the food category and have a price without tax of 1000 yen or over. We use the DELETE statement to remove records from the items table that satisfy the condition specified in the WHERE clause.

# Step 5: Show the list of shops in the Kanto region
This step asks for the SQL query to retrieve a list of shops in the Kanto region. We use the SELECT statement to retrieve columns id, name, prefecture, and city from the shops table. We add the WHERE clause to filter out shops that do not belong to the specified Kanto prefectures (prefecture IN ('Ibaraki', 'Tochigi', 'Gunma', 'Saitama', 'Chiba', 'Tokyo', 'Kanagawa')). We also use the DISTINCT keyword to ensure that the output results are distinct.

# Step 6: List the top 20 cheapest foods
This step asks for the SQL query to retrieve the top 20 cheapest food items from the items table. We use the SELECT statement to retrieve columns id, name, and price from the items table where the category is food (category = 0). We order the results by price and then by id if prices are the same. We also use the DISTINCT keyword to ensure that the output results are distinct. Finally, we use the LIMIT keyword to limit the output results to the top 20 items.

# Step 7: Count up the total number of items for each category
This step asks for the SQL query to count up the total number of items for each category in the items table. We use the SELECT statement to retrieve columns category and item_count from the items table. We use the COUNT function to count the number of items for each category and group the results by category using the GROUP BY clause. We also use the DISTINCT keyword to ensure that the output results are distinct.

# Step 8: Show the list of prefectures having five or more shops
This step asks for the SQL query to retrieve a list of prefectures that have five or more shops in the shops table. We use the SELECT statement to retrieve the prefecture column from the shops table. We use the GROUP BY clause to group the results by prefecture. We add the HAVING clause to filter out prefectures that have less than five shops. We also use the DISTINCT keyword to ensure that the output results are distinct.
